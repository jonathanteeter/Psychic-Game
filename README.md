# Psychic-Game
The Psychic-Game will run in the browser, and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code.

## What the project does
Essentially, the app randomly picks a letter, and the user has to guess which letter the app chose.

## Objective of game
A win occurs when the player guesses the same letter the computer randomly selected, else the player looses.  Good news...the player gets several chances to guess the computer letter.  A win counter and loss counter keeps track of the score.

## Why the project is useful
This was by and large a JavaScript problem to solve with some CSS styling.

## Challenges
The most difficult challenge was setting up the radio button quiz and validating which radio button was selected for each question.
