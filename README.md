# Psychic-Game
This is a simple application whereby the application randomly picks a letter.  The player then has to guess which letter is chosen.  

## Design & Technology
* This application runs in the browser and is powered by JavaScript that dynamically updates the HTML and CSS web page.
* Key technologies used to build this application are:
    * HTML
    * CSS
    * JavaScript

## What the project does
* A win occurs when the player guesses the same letter the computer randomly selects.  Otherwise, the player looses.  
* Good news!  The player gets several chances to guess the computer letter.  
* Win and Loss counters keeps track of the score.

## Challenges
This was by and large a JavaScript problem to solve with some CSS styling.
