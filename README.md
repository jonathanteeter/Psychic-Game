# Psychic-Game
The Psychic-Game application randomly picks a letter, and the user has to guess which letter is chosen.  

## Accomplishments
This application features is powered by JavaScript code that dynamically updates HTML and CSS web page.

## Objective of game
A win occurs when the player guesses the same letter the computer randomly selects.  Otherwise, the player looses.  Good news...the player gets several chances to guess the computer letter.  A win counter and loss counter keeps track of the score.

## Why the project is useful
This was by and large a JavaScript problem to solve with some CSS styling.
